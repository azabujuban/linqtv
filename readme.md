#LINQ provider for accessing TheTVDB.com
[TheTVDB.com](TheTVDB.com) is a great source for information about TV shows. They also provide an API to access it. Unfortunately, while simple it's not convenient which together with my desire to try build a LINQ provider seemed like a perfect candidate.

This is very much work in progress. As a matter of fact what builds right now doesn't actually work at all. My aim is to have a test driven process and as such the first commit to master (which is supposed to be the working build) is just one test.
